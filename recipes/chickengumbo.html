  <h3>Description:</h3>

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
    <li>1/2 lb Andouille sausage, sliced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Cooked white rice for serving</li>
    <li>Chopped green onions for garnish</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large, heavy pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Gradually add the flour, stirring constantly to create a roux. Continue cooking and stirring until the roux turns a deep, rich brown color. Be patient, as this step takes about 15-20 minutes. A dark roux will give the gumbo its characteristic flavor and color.</li>
    <li>Once the roux is ready, add the chopped onions, bell pepper, and celery to the pot. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are softened and the onions are translucent.</li>
    <li>Stir in the minced garlic, dried thyme, dried oregano, paprika, cayenne pepper, bay leaves, salt, and black pepper. Cook for an additional 2 minutes until the spices become aromatic.</li>
    <li>Gradually pour in the chicken broth while stirring to incorporate the roux mixture with the liquid. Add the diced tomatoes and their juices. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil.</li>
    <li>Add the sliced Andouille sausage and chopped chicken to the pot. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the gumbo simmer for about 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</li>
    <li>As the gumbo simmers, periodically skim off any excess oil that rises to the surface.</li>
    <li>Taste the gumbo and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper if desired.</li>
    <li>Serve the gumbo hot over cooked white rice. Garnish with chopped green onions for a fresh and flavorful finish.</li>
