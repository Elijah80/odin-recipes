## Introduction

In this project, I aimed to build a recipe website using only HTML and CSS. The site includes multiple recipes, each displayed on its own page. The primary purpose of this project was to showcase my understanding of HTML for structuring content and CSS for styling.

## Features

- Home Page: A landing page introducing the website and its purpose.
- Recipe Pages: Individual pages for different recipes, each with a title, ingredients list, instructions, and an image.
- Navigation: A simple navigation menu that allows users to easily navigate between recipe pages.
- Responsive Design: The site is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across various devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Used for structuring the content of the website.
- CSS3: Applied for styling and layout design.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Elijah80/odin-recipes.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd odin-recipes`
3. Open any recipe page in your preferred web browser: `index.html`, `recipe1.html`, `recipe2.html`, etc.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the online resources and tutorials that helped me learn and implement HTML and CSS concepts effectively. This project wouldn't have been possible without the support of the web development community.

Feel free to explore the code and the website itself to see how I applied my HTML and CSS skills to create this basic recipe site. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out!
